> Traveling is a brutality. It forces you to trust strangers and to lose sight of all that familiar comfort of home and friends.
> You are constantly off balance. Nothing is yours except the essential things â€” air, sleep, dreams, sea, the sky â€” all things tending towards the eternal or what we imagine of it.

â€” Cesare Pavese
