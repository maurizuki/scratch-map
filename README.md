> Traveling is a brutality. It forces you to trust strangers and to lose sight of all that familiar comfort of home and friends.
> You are constantly off balance. Nothing is yours except the essential things â€” air, sleep, dreams, sea, the sky â€” all things tending towards the eternal or what we imagine of it.

â€” Cesare Pavese

# My scratch map

## How to get yours
1. [Create a repository from this one](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. [Configure the publishing source for the GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
3. Edit [docs/visited-countries.js](docs/visited-countries.js): set the object `visitedCountries` to the countries that you have visited, for example `visitedCountries = { US: "#ff0000", GB: "#00ff00" }` highlights the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom in red and green, respectively.
4. Wait until the *pages build and deployment* workflow ends.
5. If you kept the original repo name, you should find your scratch map at *https://**user_name**.github.io/scratch-map/*.
6. Have a good journey! ðŸ§³
